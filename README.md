# Illuminator
Completely open-source LED board for FRC visual processing tasks.

Idea based on: Sneaky Snakes' Gloworm LEDboard: https://github.com/KahramanAkyuz/Gloworm and Gloworm Vision's Gloworm: https://github.com/gloworm-vision/gloworm

Index:

• "Illuminator" is the first version of the design.

• "Illuminator BOOST" is an upgrade board for ILL.v1.

• "Illuminator" is the second version. This version has a MCU (ATmega328) and temperature sensors on both side of the board. Thus it can work with a closed feedback loop algorithm. We've written an Arduino IDE library for the v2 board. Library files are also included in the repository in software folder.
